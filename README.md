= Fu Programming Language

Fu is a programming language targetting high-performance computing and systems programming domains. It's high level like Haskell but allows a great deal of control over the memory layout your data structures and control structures. Also, it's possible to take detailed control of the GC and also to even do explicit memory management. It should be possible to build something like a DBMS, OS, device driver, language runtime or GC in Fu without sacrificing anything. No compromises. That's the principle in any case.
